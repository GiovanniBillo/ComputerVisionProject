# ComputerVisionProject

This repo contains all the files and documents for the project of the course 'Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition' by prof.Pellegrino at the University of Trieste.

# Instructions
We provide a shell script to run experiments on a computing cluster with SLURM.
To do this, simply execute the following:
```
sbatch cvpr_job.sh
```
This will launch a full evaluation and fit of all the models. Please beware that this can take some time to execute.
